# Meet My Friend Sofia

## Dating app to enable match-making for your single friends.

Everyone has a friend who is smart, funny, kind, generous, and generally an all-around good person.

But this friend is single.

Maybe your friend matches with lousy people on Tinder. Maybe he or she isn't willing to filter through online profiles. Maybe he or she is busy enjoying enjoying life, climbing the career ladder, parenting wonderful children, or is just putting mate selection on auto-pilot.

With the "Meet My Friend Sofia" app, created by Sofia Hellerstedt and Nicole Hall, you'll be able to view the friends of other matchmakers' and set up dates. Soon your single friend who has all the right stuff will find the partner you know is the right match.
